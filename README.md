# reviews
Classes and xml files for the review section for the professors. You should be able to copy and paste without much configuration. All the references, firebase, and variable IDs are already setup for you.
This should have all the files necessary for waleed to copy and paste for the csci subject as of (11/23).
I will be working on the other subjects later on.
